## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

The list of apps that are my favorite are:
*Snapchat: I can see if they are active in the chat or not. I can also send view-only once pictures/videos.
*Instagram: I can again send view-only once pictures/videos.
*TikTok: I can see who viewed my profile.

Thinking of an idea, I want to improve an existing app and that is Instagram. Whenever we post a story on Instagram and you want to find out if a specific person liked it or not, you will havr to scroll through it. It would be a lot better if there was a search button on it.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
